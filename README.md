# Regression Project: Predicting House Prices

## Overview
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict house prices based on features. The goal is to explore the relationship between the features and the target variable (price) and evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score.

## Project Description
This project uses a dataset containing information about houses. A Linear, Ridge & Lasso regression model is trained to predict house prices based on these features. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Cross-validation for performance assessment

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
